#**CRYOGENIC DEVICES RESERCH**

###**研究目标**
Focusing on the cryo-temperature physics and electrical properties of advanced technology CMOS devices, we explore a reliable way to establish a universal low-temperature DC/RF device model and cryo-temperature circuit design platform that can cover the full temperature region, full size and broadband domain, and build a bridge between cryo-temperature circuit design and chip manufacturing.
